# Digit-Recognition

The project takes MNIST Digit Data as input for training and predicts the corresponding digit based on the image.

The CNN model used in this project is as follows

Input -> Conv2D -> MaxPool2D -> Conv2D -> MaxPool2D -> Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Output

#### `Input -> Conv2D -> MaxPool2D -> Conv2D -> MaxPool2D -> Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Output`
